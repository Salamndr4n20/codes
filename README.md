### Main Function Points
- Conceptual designs for various physical and digital music synthesizers
- Sleek and futuristic interface designs
- Focus on features like granular synthesis, polyphony, and integration between different synthesizer modules

### Technology Stack
The project appears to be focused on conceptual design, initially started with, html., then I thought it should be, more of a stand alone application, so I switched it to the Java platform, then I wanted sone differentand features and more of complex  sound, and sound designing features, so I SWITCHED IN TO Python 3.13, I forgot to list dependencies.They are written in the code, as a part of system, I have now made the decision, to implement them as software VST3 plug-ins from the Juce platform,  but as my body catches up with my imagination we should have some more futuristic models, so bare with me on this, thank you.
